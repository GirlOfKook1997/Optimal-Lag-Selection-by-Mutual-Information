# Optimal-Lag-Selection-by-RUIQI-WU
2022.06.17 Version
Here I upload the paper I ready to replicate and codes I wrote.
In the code,the dataset I use is Dow Jones Index from 2002-06-13 to 2022-06-13.
The original feature sets is {High(t),Open(t),Low(t),Volume(t)},and the target variable is Close(t+1).
After Lag selection, the optimal subsets is {High(t),Open(t),Low(t),Volume(t-5)},and the target variable is Close(t+1).
